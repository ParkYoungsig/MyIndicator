Patch: Direction B categorized copies
- Modified: research/backtester/cli.py
  * Added: import shutil
  * Added: _copy_artifacts_to_category_folders(run_dir: Path)
  * Added: call to _copy_artifacts_to_category_folders(run_dir) at end of _save_results()

Behavior:
- Existing root-level result artifacts are unchanged (not moved/renamed).
- Additional copies are created under charts/, tables/, logs/, configs/, report/ within each run output folder.
